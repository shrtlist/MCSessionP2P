@class SessionController
@abstract
A SessionController creates the MCSession that peers will be invited/join
into, as well as creating service advertisers and browsers.

MCSessionDelegate calls occur on a private operation queue. If your app
needs to perform an action on a particular run loop or operation queue,
its delegate method should explicitly dispatch or schedule that work
